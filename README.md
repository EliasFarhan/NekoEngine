# Neko Game Engine 
develop branch: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EliasFarhan/NekoEngine.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/EliasFarhan/NekoEngine)

Neko is a 3D game engine based on SDL2 and OpenGL ES 3.0 that works on Desktop (Windows and Linux, not MacOSX), WebGL2 and Nintendo Switch (port to Android and iOS possible) used at [SAE Institute Geneva](https://sae.swiss).

## Requirements
### Windows
Install CMake ([https://cmake.org/download/]), the Vulkan SDK ([https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/]) and Python3 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/]). Visual Studio 2019 is recommended on Windows.
### Ubuntu
Because we use C++17 filesystem, you will need at least Ubuntu 19.10 to compile with the latest libstdc++ or even better Clang and libc++. You will need to install the packages:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsdl2-dev glslang-tools python3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libzstd-dev 
```
### Android
Simply use Android Studio and open the android/GPR5300 folder. You will need to install NDK. The Android Studio cmake version is too old so put your recent cmake into the PATH as well as Ninja ([https://ninja-build.org/]).
### Emscripten/WebGL
Install the emsdk. Then you can:
```
emcmake cmake .. # it will not work the first time?
emcmake cmake ..
make comp_graph # only the comp graph executable is currently working 
```
